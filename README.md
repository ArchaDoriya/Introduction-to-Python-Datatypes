# Introduction-to-Python-Datatypes
The objective of this notebook is to walk through different sorts of datatypes that are built into python. In this notebook I will briefly describe both basic data types (int, float, string, decimal, complex and boolean) as well as collection data types such as list, tuple, dictionaries and sets. By the end of this tutorial, we will be familiar with what object of these types look like and how to represent them.
